        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>I have an amazing dad who cares about my grades more than anything, a beautiful mother who only cares about me and my brother having the childhood she never had, and the best little brother I could ever ask for. I have always loved to swim and have been swiming since i was 6 because of this for the pat three years i have been in junioor lifeguards. I was enrolled in junior lifeguards with my two bestfriends Jordan and Rachel. I am happy to say that Jordan and Rachel have been my bestfriends for three years. We do absolutly everything together and will never seperate. Most people have one bestfriend but i think two is just more to love.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies </h2>
            <p>I dont have many hobbies but i know that my hobbies are exroidinary.
				One of my hobbies is binge watching any show on netflix. Once I start a show i cant stop watching it. A usual series takes me no more than a week to watch. Me and my mom have always bonded throught binge watching and normally we always have a show to watch.
				Another one of my hobbies is Junior lifeguards. I have been in junior lifeguards for threes years now. After three years in junior lifeguards i am certified for CPR and have been to three CPR classes. I also know how to correctly save someone from drowning.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I am interested in working with small children becuase i have always loved toplay with little kids and be in charge. I understand that children are one of the hardest to work with, especially small children, but i have always been good with children. 
				I am also interested in bike riding. i have always loved being active and going outside. almost every weekend im out on my bike with my friends or family. I like going long distance riding. I like going uphill because not only is it a challenge getting uphill but you still have the rest of the ride so its even more of a challenge.
