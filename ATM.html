            <h2>Sixth Grade</h2>
                <p>Sixth grade was my introduction to the ATM program and it was the hardest for me to adapt to computers. Before the ATM program I knew nothing </p>

            <h2>Seventh Grade</h2>
                <p>I hope to get in UCLA or USC. I would like to get into UCLA because my grandma went there and says she had an amazing time there. I want to go to USC becuase I dont want to leave California and i have many close family friends who went there. These schools are close to me becuase the people who i look up to went to these schools. My parents want me to go to harvord or somewhere far so i could get the experience but i just want to go to a school close so i can be there for all the holidays and not have to worry about a flight delay or missing a flight</p>

            <h2>Eighth Grade</h2>
                <p>I hope to work at a elementary school and be a kindergarten teacher. I would also like to work as a pediatrician. I have always known that i wanted to work with kids i just never decided if i want to be a kindergarten teacher or a pediatrician. Even though i havent decided i know that they are both are a big responsiblity especially since they are both working with children but i have always loved children and loved how children are so unpredictable. For example one minute they are as happy as ever then the next they are the sadest</p>

            <h2>ATM Reflection</h2>
                <p>I hope to go to a good college and be a successful and independent woman a who has a job I love. It has always been a goal for me to be able to take my parents to a nice dinner at a steakhouse and be able to buy all of us dinner and dessert. It may seem odd but that is my all time gaol and that is when i feel that i have suceeded in life. Another goal of mine is similar to  the last gaol but I also have always wanted to take my parentsto the mall and tell them to get whatever they want because im paying. I would like to this because my parents spoil me and want to do the same for them.</a>
